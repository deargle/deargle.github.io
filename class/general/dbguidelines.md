<div style='width:50%'> 
<table class='table table-bordered'>
  <tbody>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Query 1</td>
      <td>Query 2</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>multiple table join</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>subquery</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
